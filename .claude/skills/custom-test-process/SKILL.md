# Custom Test Process

## Purpose

This is a **project-specific custom skill** called by the Builder workflow to run the full test cycle.
It handles starting servers, running tests, and verifying health endpoints specific to this project (claudecode_webui).

Generic workflow skills invoke this skill if it exists; if absent, the test step is skipped.

## When Called

The Builder invokes this skill from its working directory (the worktree). Environment variables (ports) come from `custom-environment-setup`.

## Input

Environment from `custom-environment-setup`:
- `BACKEND_PORT`: Backend server port (8000 + issue_number % 1000)
- `VITE_PORT`: Vite dev server port (5000 + issue_number % 1000)

## Test Lifecycle

This skill owns the full test lifecycle in a single invocation:

### 1. Start Backend Server

```bash
uv run python main.py --debug-all --port ${BACKEND_PORT} &
```

Wait for server to be ready:
```bash
# Wait up to 30 seconds for backend
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
    curl -s http://localhost:${BACKEND_PORT}/health > /dev/null 2>&1 && break
    sleep 1
done
```

### 2. Start Frontend Dev Server (if frontend changed)

**CRITICAL:** Set `VITE_BACKEND_PORT` so the vite dev server proxies to the correct per-issue backend port instead of the default 8001:

```bash
cd frontend && VITE_BACKEND_PORT=${BACKEND_PORT} npm run dev -- --port ${VITE_PORT} &
```

The `VITE_BACKEND_PORT` environment variable is read by `vite.config.js` to configure the proxy target. Without this, the frontend would proxy requests to port 8001 (the default) instead of the issue-specific backend port.

### 3. Run Unit Tests

```bash
uv run pytest src/tests/ -v
```

### 4. Verify Health Endpoints

```bash
# Check backend health
curl -s http://localhost:${BACKEND_PORT}/health

# Check frontend (if started)
curl -s http://localhost:${VITE_PORT}
```

### 5. Leave Servers Running

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT stop servers after testing. Leave them running for user review.
The `custom-cleanup-process` skill handles stopping servers later.

## Test Verification

- Server starts without errors
- Health endpoint returns success
- Unit tests pass
- No regressions introduced

## Usage by Generic Skills

The Builder workflow calls this skill like:

```
Invoke custom-test-process skill
```

The skill uses port information from the environment (provided by custom-environment-setup).
It may use the `process-manager` skill internally for process management.
If this skill does not exist, the generic workflow skips the test step.
