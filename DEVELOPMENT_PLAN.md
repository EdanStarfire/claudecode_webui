## Phase 4: Project-Based Session Organization ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Implement hierarchical project-based organization with sessions grouped by working directories
**Status**: Complete - full hierarchical project system implemented

### Overview
Transform the current flat session list into a hierarchical project-based organization where sessions are grouped by source directories. Projects serve as containers for sessions that share a common working directory, providing better organization and workspace management.

### User Experience Stories

#### US-1: Project Creation & Management
- Working directory selection moves from session creation to project settings
- Creating a session within a project automatically uses the project's working directory
- Projects display both name and absolute folder path
- Folder paths are always absolute and immutable after creation
- Path display shows formatted paths based on depth (1-2 folders: full path, 3+ folders: `.../parent/folder`)
- Hovering over truncated path shows full absolute path in tooltip

#### US-2: Session-Project Relationship
- Sessions are created directly from project using hover-reveal "+" button on project item
- No global "create session" button - all creation is project-contextual
- Project stores list of child session IDs in its state (`session_ids: List[str]`)
- Sessions can only be moved within their parent project (order changes only)
- Sessions cannot be moved between projects (project assignment is permanent)
- Deleting a project prompts user to confirm deletion of all associated sessions
- Loading project sessions is fast (read from project state, not scanning all sessions)

#### US-3: Project Visual Status Indicator
- Each project displays a single continuous multi-colored status line below project header
- Status line segments are seamless (no gaps between segments)
- Number of segments = number of sessions in project (5 sessions = 5 equal-width segments)
- Each segment represents one session, colored by session state
- Status line updates immediately when any session state changes
- Status line visible even when project is collapsed
- Empty projects show single gray segment or "no sessions" indicator

#### US-4: Project Expansion & Collapse
- Projects have expand/collapse controls (▶ collapsed, ▼ expanded)
- Collapsed projects hide all session items in the list
- Collapsed projects still show project status line reflecting all sessions
- Expansion state persists in project state file (`data/projects/{project_id}/state.json`)
- Expansion state survives application restart and works across devices
- Clicking project header (not just arrow) toggles expansion
- New projects default to expanded state (`is_expanded: true`)

#### US-5: Project & Session Reordering
- Projects can be drag-and-dropped to reorder among other projects
- Sessions can be drag-and-dropped within their parent project only
- Dragging a session to a different project is prevented (visual feedback)
- Visual drop indicators show valid drop targets
- Project order persists across restarts
- Session order within project persists across restarts

#### US-6: Path Display & Tooltips
- All paths stored as absolute paths (immutable after project creation)
- Path display logic:
  - **1 folder**: `/foldername` (no ellipsis)
  - **2 folders**: `/parent/folder` (no ellipsis)
  - **3+ folders**: `.../parent/folder` (ellipsis prefix)
- Project list shows: `[Project Name] - [formatted path]`
- Hovering over path shows full absolute path in tooltip
- Paths cannot be changed after project creation (immutable)

### Technical Implementation

#### Data Model Changes

**Project Model (NEW)**
```python
@dataclass
class ProjectInfo:
    project_id: str                 # UUID
    name: str                       # User-friendly name
    working_directory: str          # Absolute path (IMMUTABLE)
    session_ids: List[str]          # Ordered list of child session IDs
    is_expanded: bool = True        # Expansion state (persisted)
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    order: int                      # Display order among projects
```

**Session Model Updates**
- `order` field meaning updated to "order within project" (not global)
- NO `project_id` field - parent tracked in `ProjectInfo.session_ids`

**File Structure**
```
data/
├── projects/
│   └── {project_id}/
│       └── state.json          # ProjectInfo serialized
└── sessions/
    └── {session_id}/
        ├── messages.jsonl
        ├── state.json          # SessionInfo (no project_id)
