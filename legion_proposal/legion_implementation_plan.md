# Legion Multi-Agent System - Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Implementation Strategy

**Phased Approach**: 8 phases over approximately 9 weeks
- Each phase builds on previous work
- Each phase has clear deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Testing integrated throughout, not just at end
- Documentation updated continuously

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Start with smallest useful increment (Phase 1)
- Validate architecture early (Phase 2)
- Get core functionality working before advanced features
- Regular review points after each phase

### 1.2 Dependencies

**Must Complete Before Starting**:
- Review and finalize requirements document
- Review and finalize technical design document
- Review and finalize UX design document
- Set up development environment
- Agree on coding standards and review process

**External Dependencies**:
- Claude Agent SDK (existing, stable)
- Existing Claude WebUI codebase (reference implementation)

## 3. Testing Strategy

### 3.1 Testing Levels

**Unit Tests**:
- All data models (validation, serialization)
- All business logic methods
- Utility functions
- Target: >90% code coverage

**Integration Tests**:
- CommRouter with SessionCoordinator
- OverseerController with CommRouter
- API endpoints with full stack
- WebSocket event flow

**End-to-End Tests**:
- Full user workflows (create legion ‚Üí create minion ‚Üí send Comm)
- Multi-minion scenarios
- Channel broadcasting
- Spawning and disposal

**Performance Tests**:
- 20 concurrent minions
- 1000+ Comms in timeline
- Rapid spawning/disposing

### 3.2 Testing Tools

**Backend**:
- pytest (unit and integration tests)
- pytest-asyncio (async tests)
- pytest-mock (mocking)
- pytest-cov (coverage)

**Frontend**:
- Jest (unit tests)
- React Testing Library (component tests)
- Cypress or Playwright (E2E tests)

**Performance**:
- locust or k6 (load testing)
- Python profiler (cProfile)

### 3.3 CI/CD

**Continuous Integration**:
- Run all tests on every commit
- Block merge if tests fail
- Generate coverage reports

**Deployment**:
- Manual deployment (local workstation for MVP)
- Future: Docker container, one-click deploy

## 4. Risk Management

### 4.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **SDK session overhead too high** | Start with 5-minion limit in testing | Implement minion pausing/pooling |
| **Message queue overflow** | Add rate limiting early | Implement queue depth limits |
| **Memory distillation loses critical info** | Manual review in Phase 7 | Add human review checkpoints |
| **WebSocket connection limits** | Monitor connection count | Implement connection pooling |
| **Timeline UI sluggish with many Comms** | Implement virtualization in Phase 8 | Pagination-only fallback |

### 4.2 Schedule Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Phase takes longer than estimated** | Build buffer into each phase (1-2 days) | Descope non-critical features |
| **Dependency on SDK changes** | Pin SDK version, test early | Isolate SDK integration, easy to swap |
| **Integration issues between phases** | Integration tests at end of each phase | Refactor if architecture flawed |

### 4.3 Scope Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Feature creep** | Strict adherence to MVP scope | Defer non-MVP features to backlog |
| **Requirements change mid-development** | Review requirements after each phase | Re-plan remaining phases |

## 5. Review Points

### After Each Phase

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] All deliverables complete?
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met?
- [ ] All tests passing?
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality?
- [ ] Performance acceptable?
- [ ] Documentation updated?

**Go/No-Go Decision**:
- If yes to all ‚Üí proceed to next phase
- If no ‚Üí identify blockers, address before proceeding

### Mid-Project Review (After Phase 4)

**Assessment**:
- Are we on schedule?
- Is architecture working as expected?
- Any major issues discovered?
- Do requirements need adjustment?

**Adjustments**:
- Revise remaining phases if needed
- Descope if behind schedule
- Add resources if available

### Pre-Launch Review (After Phase 8)

**Validation**:
- All use cases working?
- Performance acceptable?
- Documentation complete?
- Known bugs acceptable?

**Launch Decision**:
- Ready for production use?
- Or: need additional polish phase?

## 6. Post-MVP Roadmap

### 6.1 Deferred Features (High Priority)

**Advanced Memory Management** (2-3 weeks):
- Vector database integration for semantic search
- Automatic memory consolidation across minions
- Memory conflict resolution (forked minions)

**Advanced Coordination** (2-3 weeks):
- Consensus protocols for multi-minion decisions
- Voting mechanisms
- Automated performance scoring

**Enhanced Tooling** (1-2 weeks):

## 8. Appendix: Estimation Details

### Estimation Methodology

**Story Points to Days**:
- Small task (1 point) = 0.5 days
- Medium task (2-3 points) = 1-2 days
- Large task (5 points) = 3-4 days
- Very large task (8 points) = 5+ days

**Buffer**:
- Each phase has 1-2 day buffer
- Total project buffer: 1 week (included in 9-week estimate)

### Assumptions

- Single developer, full-time
- No major architecture changes mid-project
- SDK remains stable
- No unexpected external dependencies

### Confidence Levels

- Phase 1-3: High confidence (well-defined, low risk)
- Phase 4-6: Medium confidence (some unknowns in SDK integration)
- Phase 7-8: Medium-low confidence (complex logic, many edge cases)
