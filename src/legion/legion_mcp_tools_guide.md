## üì® Communication System - CRITICAL

### Identifying Messages from the Comm System

Messages delivered through the Legion comm system have a **distinct format** that you must recognize:

**Format indicators:**
- Sender prefixed with "Minion #" (e.g., "Minion #user", "Minion #DatabaseExpert")
- Emoji prefix indicating type: üìã Task, ‚ùì Question, üìä Report, üí° Info
- Header with summary, followed by full content
- Messages from user include: "Please respond using the send_comm tool"

**Example comm system message:**
```
**üìã Task from Minion #user:** Analyze the authentication system

Please review the OAuth implementation in src/auth/ and identify potential security issues.

---
**Please respond using the send_comm tool to send your reply back to Minion #user.**
```

### When to Use send_comm

‚úÖ **DO use send_comm when:**
- Replying to a message with "Minion #" prefix in the sender name
- Proactively contacting another minion for collaboration
- Sending reports or updates to the user through the comm system
- Asking questions to other minions or the user via comm

‚ùå **DO NOT use send_comm when:**
- The user is chatting directly in your session window (no "Minion #" prefix)
- Responding to regular conversation without comm system formatting
- The message doesn't have the comm system header format

### send_comm Tool Usage

```python
# Basic message to another minion
send_comm(
    to_minion_name="DatabaseExpert",
    summary="Question about schema design",
    content="What's the best approach for storing user preferences? Should we use JSON columns or a separate table?",
    comm_type="question"
)

# Reply to user through comm system
send_comm(
    to_minion_name="user",
    summary="Authentication analysis complete",
    content="## Security Analysis Results\n\n‚úÖ OAuth implementation is secure\n‚ùå Found potential CSRF vulnerability in token refresh\n\nDetails: ...",
    comm_type="report"
)

# Task delegation
send_comm(
    to_minion_name="TestingExpert",
    summary="Request for integration tests",
    content="Please create integration tests for the new payment API endpoints in src/api/payments.py",
    comm_type="task"
)
```

**Comm Types:**
- `task` - Assign work to another minion
- `question` - Ask for information or clarification
- `report` - Share findings or progress updates
- `info` - General information sharing

**Remember:** Always provide both `summary` (brief ~50 chars) and `content` (full detailed message with markdown).

## ü§ñ Spawning Child Minions

### When to Spawn

Spawn child minions when:
- **Task decomposition**: Breaking complex work into parallel subtasks
- **Specialized expertise**: Need focused knowledge (database, security, frontend, etc.)
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple independent tasks that can run simultaneously
- **Experimentation**: Testing different approaches concurrently

### When NOT to Spawn

Avoid spawning when:
- Task is simple enough for you to handle directly
- Task requires sequential steps that can't be parallelized
- You're unsure about requirements (clarify first)
- Adding coordination overhead exceeds benefit
- You've already spawned many children (avoid over-spawning)

### How to Spawn Effectively

```python
# Good: Clear, specific initialization_context
spawn_minion(
    name="DatabaseOptimizer",
    role="Database Performance Specialist",
    initialization_context=(
        "You are a database performance expert.\n\n"
        "Your task: Analyze query performance in src/db/queries.py and recommend optimizations.\n\n"
        "Specific goals:\n"
        "1. Identify N+1 query patterns\n"
        "2. Suggest indexing strategies\n"
        "3. Recommend caching opportunities\n\n"
        "Constraints:\n"
        "- Focus only on read performance (writes are already optimized)\n"
        "- Don't modify schema without approval\n"
        "- Provide concrete code examples\n\n"
        "When done, send a report to me with your findings."
    ),
    capabilities=["database", "performance", "postgresql"]
)
```

**Best practices for initialization_context:**
- Start with role description
- Clearly state the task and goals
- Specify constraints and boundaries
- Define success criteria
- Explain how/when to report back
- Use numbered lists for clarity

**Naming conventions:**
- Descriptive and unique within legion
- Use PascalCase or kebab-case
- Examples: "FrontendArchitect", "SecurityAuditor", "test-writer-api"

### Capability Tags

Use capability tags for discovery:
- Technical: "python", "javascript", "rust", "database", "api", "frontend", "backend"
- Domain: "authentication", "payments", "security", "testing", "devops"
- Task: "code-review", "debugging", "optimization", "documentation"

## üóëÔ∏è Disposing Child Minions

### When to Dispose

Dispose child minions when:
- Their assigned task is complete
- They're no longer needed for the current work
- They've sent their final report
- You need to free capacity for new minions

### Parent Authority Model

**CRITICAL**: You can ONLY dispose minions that YOU spawned (your direct children).
- You cannot dispose your parent
- You cannot dispose your siblings
- You cannot dispose other minions' children
- Attempting unauthorized disposal returns an error

### Memory Transfer

When you dispose a child:
- Their knowledge is preserved and transferred to you
- Their session messages become part of historical context
- Their findings and learnings are available for future reference

### How to Dispose

```python
# Dispose after task completion
dispose_minion(minion_name="DatabaseOptimizer")

# The tool returns confirmation and preserves their knowledge
# Result: "‚úÖ Successfully disposed of minion 'DatabaseOptimizer'.
#          Their knowledge has been preserved and will be available to you."
```

**Cleanup responsibility:**
- Dispose children when they finish their work
- Don't leave idle minions running indefinitely
- Cascading disposal: disposing a minion also disposes all their descendants

## üîç Discovery and Collaboration

### Finding Collaborators

```python
# Search by capability
search_capability(capability="database")
# Returns ranked list of minions with database expertise

# List all minions
list_minions()
# Returns all active minions with names, roles, states, capabilities

# Get details about specific minion
get_minion_info(minion_name="SecurityExpert")
# Returns detailed info including parent/children, channels, current task
```

### Channel Collaboration

Channels enable group communication:

```python
# Create a channel for coordination
create_channel(
    name="api-redesign",
    description="Coordination channel for API redesign project",
    purpose="coordination",
    initial_members=["BackendDev", "FrontendDev", "DatabaseExpert"]
)

# Join existing channel
join_channel(channel_name="api-redesign")

# Broadcast to channel
send_comm_to_channel(
    channel_name="api-redesign",
    summary="Schema changes proposed",
    content="I've drafted new schema for API v2. Please review: [details]...",
    comm_type="info"
)
```

---

## üí° Best Practices

### Communication
- Always use descriptive summaries (shown in timeline collapsed view)
- Use markdown formatting in content for readability
- Choose appropriate comm_type (task/question/report/info)
- Reference other minions with #minion-name syntax in messages

### Spawning Strategy
- Start with 1-3 children for complex tasks
- Give each child a clear, focused responsibility
- Provide complete context in initialization_context
- Tag children with relevant capabilities

### Coordination
- Use channels for multi-minion collaboration
- Search capabilities before spawning duplicates
- Send progress reports to parent or user
- Dispose children promptly when done

### Error Handling
- If a minion isn't found, check spelling and use list_minions
- If spawn fails, check capacity limits and name uniqueness
- If dispose fails, verify parent authority (only dispose your children)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using send_comm for regular user chat** - Only use send_comm when message has "Minion #" prefix
2. **Over-spawning** - Don't create minions for trivial tasks you can handle
3. **Vague initialization_context** - Be specific about goals and constraints
4. **Forgetting to dispose** - Clean up children when their work is done
5. **Unauthorized disposal** - Only dispose your direct children, not siblings or parents

---

## üìö Summary

You have powerful tools for collaboration and hierarchy management:
- **Identify comm system messages** by "Minion #" prefix
- **Use send_comm** only for comm system replies, not regular chat
- **Spawn children** for specialized work with clear context
- **Dispose children** when tasks complete (only your own children)
- **Collaborate via channels** for group coordination
- **Search capabilities** to find existing experts before spawning

These tools enable autonomous, intelligent task decomposition and team collaboration. Use them wisely to maximize efficiency and minimize coordination overhead.
